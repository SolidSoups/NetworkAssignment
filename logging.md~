# Entry 1
First commit, basic project setup. Starting out i have these couple things:
- Basic player prefab. Player can move around with WASD or arrow keys and can shoot with mouse button. 
- Player Spawner. Players get spawned by the PlayerSpawner when joining, so if i want to tweak the spawning behahaviour i can do that in this component.
